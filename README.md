Build Information 
This section contains general CCRS build information that results from the CCRS build process. Builds are done continuously with Jenkins. Jenkins uses source from Git to build whenever changes are made to the Git repository. Artifacts from these builds are made available through the Jenkins interface. Database Schema updates are propagated to the VA CCRS Databases through Flyway, a version control for SQL databases. Release candidate binaries, ETL code, Schema updates, and Interfaces code are packaged together for promotion through the target environments
The Template has each element that is needed and has an explanation of each element requested.
